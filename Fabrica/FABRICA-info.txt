FABRICA v1.0
---------------------------------------
Fabrica is a deceptively simple sans serif typeface optimized for screen display on handheld devices. With its optimal quality and legibility, Fabrica proves to be highly efficient for small screens. Its details are drawn from the more systematic constructed Neo-Grotesques, giving it a neutral tone of voice. Above all, Fabrica’s beauty is found in its functionality.
