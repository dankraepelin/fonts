Helvetica and Helvetica Neue fonts do not come preinstalled on PC but 
they do on the Mac. Therefore there are many formats and poor conversions 
circulating out there, which leads to different naming, messed up font grouping
and broken fonts in web browsers. 

Not any more!

If you have troubles removing your old Helvetica fonts from Windows then:
1. Boot up in "Safe mode with command prompt" by pressing F8 before Win starts.
2. In command prompt mode type "cd c:\windows\fonts", hit enter.
3. Type "dir helv*.*", hit enter and make sure your font files are listed there.
4. Then type "del helv*.*" and hit enter.
This will erase all files that start with "helv" from that folder.
NOTE: Be careful what you do and use common sense!
